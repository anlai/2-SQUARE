            <p>In most software projects, limits on time, resources, and acceptable cost prevent implementation of all requirements. Requirements prioritization helps stakeholders arrange the elicited require-ments in the desired implementation order. A good requirement prioritization has some advantag-es, such as the following [Karlsson 1996, Karlsson 1997]:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>It clarifies for the project manager which requirements are important and which are mere embellishments.</li>
                <li>It provides a means to make tradeoffs between conflicting goals such as quality, cost, and time to market.</li>
                <li>It helps the project manager plan releases that will meet the customers‟ expectations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These advantages demonstrate the criticality of requirements prioritization in the requirements engineering process. This prioritization effectively determines what requirements eventually get built into the software. The results of the risk assessment performed in Step 4 and the categoriza-tion of Step 7 are important inputs for this step, the output of which is a list of requirements, along with their priorities, that all the stakeholders have agreed upon.</p>

            <p>Many unstructured and structured techniques can be used for the process of requirements prioriti-zation. Unstructured methods involve simple discussions between the stakeholders with a goal of consensus on priorities for requirements. The following section briefly explains some of the struc-tured techniques that can be used to prioritize privacy requirements.</p>
