            <p>Requirements inspection is the last step in the process and a very important one. Inspections re-move defects and clear ambiguities in the requirements. Reports suggest that more defects are introduced in the requirements-gathering phase of the software development life cycle than during any other phase [Kelly 1992], so inspections are a critical step in the requirements-gathering process.</p>

            <p>Inspections can be informal or formal. There exist a number of methods to carry out inspections, ranging from ad hoc to use of checklists and even Fagan reviews and scenario-based inspections. Various experiments show that scenario-based inspection methods provide a better defect detec-tion rate than checklist or ad hoc inspections [Porter 1995].</p>

            <p>The requirements engineering team can guide the stakeholders to use any of the available inspec-tion methods to perform this step in the process.</p>

            <p>The outcome of this process is a final privacy requirements document that has been agreed upon and verified by all the stakeholders and the requirements engineering team</p>
